### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is RaphaÃ«l Anjou, and I'm currently a student in Polytech Nice Sophia (Peip 2) aiming to go in the Computer Science course of Polytech Nice Sophia as a work-study student.

## :school: University projects

### 1. PolyDog Robot

**From November 2021 to March 2022**

This project consisted in building a robot dog using Arduino hardware.  
Here is an image of the robot :

### 2. Rogue-like game

**From March 2021 to June 2022**

This project was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Class with Python in my first year of university.  
We had to follow the code structure of the teacher for nearly the whole project. The teacher gave us more liberty near
the end, which allowed us get more creative with our work and try to code more complicated features.

## :computer: Personal projects

### 1. Website for a teacher

**Started in March 2022**

I'm building a website using React for a specialized teacher.
The content of it is currently confidential which means that I can't reveal my code at the moment.  
I will place a link here to the website when it is released.

### 2. Chess Openings Learner 

**Started in March 2022**

I'm building this project with one of my friend. We aim to develop a software in Java that would allow us, and possibly 
other users to learn chess openings in a more dynamic and interactive way.  

The core of our project is kind of similar to some flashcards apps that allow students to study.
You will be able to choose an opening to study, and then, the computer will play against you this specific opening.  

If you fail to answer with the correct move, the computer will either tell you to change your move or even start the 
whole line again.   
As you learn more and more variants, the ones you know the best will appear less often than the ones you've never 
learned, or the ones you've failed recently.

### 3. Java best practices

**Started in February 2022**

We are currently using [Java in our Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/naxomi/peip2-algorithmique-et-structure-donnees) 
class, and I want to code the correct way.  
That's why I'm trying to learn the best practices, how to comment correctly my code to be able to create JavaDocs, how
to do unit testing (with Junit5 and Mockito) or how to build correctly the structure of my code.

**Books I use :**

- _Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_ |---| Robert C. Martin
- _Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5 Test Driven Development with JUnit 5_ |---| Shekhar Gulati, Rahul Sharma
- _Mockito Essentials_ |---| Sujoy Acharya
- _Practical Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito_ |---| Tomek Kaczanowsk
